# Anti-Cheat Enforcement System

ACES is a containerized web application designed to manage software-based assignments for instructors while providing guards against various forms of cheating. The application runs through [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and utilizes Docker-Compose to build and manage different microservices, consisting of four main pieces:

1. A web frontend ([.NET Core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio
)) for uploading assignments and managing students (for instructors), and a centralized location for downloading prepared assignments (for students).

2. A database ([Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2019)) for tracking instructors, students, assignments, submissions, and student assignment commits. 

3. An HTTP API ([Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html)) for uploading assignments and preparing assignments for individual student usage.

4. A Git management web frontend ([Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/)) for holding remote repositories generated by students.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

At minimum, running ACES requires an installation of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (and, by extension, Docker-Compose). While Docker-Compose should come with most default installations of Docker (especially on macOS or Windows), separately installing Docker-Compose on Linux may be required, and it is suggested that you follow a guide based on your distribution.

**Windows 10**: [Follow the instructions for setup on Docker's documentation.](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) Make sure you have Windows 10 Professional or Enterprise, and that you are configured to run Linux containers, **not** Windows containers.

**macOS**: [Follow the instructions for setup on Docker's documentation.](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) A Homebrew installation should also be relatively painless, if you prefer. Since ACES-Factory will be manipulating folders on-disk (local to the repository), Docker should have access to macOS's filesystem (which is off by default). The easiest way to fix this is to go to `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy tab > Full Disk Access` and check the box next to Docker.

**VirtualBox and/or Linux**: Development environments for all of ACES have been successfully configured on [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org/) (which has a Desktop environment) and [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) (which is just a terminal). If you have the space, a Manjaro Linux virtual machine is an easy way to keep dependencies isolated from your hardware. 

Once Manjaro is installed, the following commands should be enough to get you running:
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu docker docker-compose
sudo systemctl start docker.service
sudo systemctl enable docker.service
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
reboot
```

### Installing

Make sure Docker is started and verify your installation by running the following in the terminal and receiving roughly the following output (note that version numbers may differ):
```
$ docker version
Client: Docker Engine - Community
 Version:           19.03.12
 [...]

Server: Docker Engine - Community
 Engine:
  Version:          19.03.12
 [...]
```

Then, clone the repository and `cd` into the appropriate folder.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bradleypeterson/ACES.git aces && cd aces/aces
```

To run all the components of ACES, run this command within the same folder:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will boot all the services required to run ACES and will pull, build, and attach networks to containers as necessary.

From here, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to verify that the web frontend and database are working. 

**To develop on a specific container, follow the instructions in the given container's README.md**.

[Database](aces/database/README.md)

[Factory](aces/factory/README.md)

## Running the tests

Coming soon!

## Deployment

The true beauty of containerized applications is that running in development and running in production is virtually the same! Eventually a true CI/CD pipeline can replace this process, but for now, deployment is pretty trivial. Make sure you have SSH access to a server that has Docker, Docker-Compose, and Git.

Clone the repository onto the server, `cd` into the correct folder, and run `docker-compose up -d`. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bradleypeterson/ACES.git aces
cd aces/aces
docker-compose up -d
```

Once everything is built, use `docker-compose ps` to observe all the running pieces of the application.

```
$ docker-compose ps
      Name                   Command              State              Ports

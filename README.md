Anti-Cheat Enforcement Software is a software engineering project of Professor Brad Peterson at Weber State University. The project is composed of three major components.
 1. View the status of each student in a course through a web client.
 2. Run various anti-cheat software to ensure that a student is properly doing their work.
 3. Automatically grade assignments operating system agnostically and compiler agnostically.
